Alex Thornton is an ICS Lecturer and Industry programmer. Well known for coding entire games in a single class, many students profess their undying love for him every year! He's also recreated numerous classes from scratch at UC Irvine, coding and preparing late into the night in order to make sure he's teaching students the news technology available! You've seen him code at lightning speed, now partner up with 99 of your peers and battle him to the death with CODE! Figuratively of course. You will have 1 hour to solve a programming problem, while Thornton tries to solve the problem. All participants will walk away with a prize, but anyone who beats Thornton and those students who finish in the top 3 will get significant prizes personalized by Thornton!
